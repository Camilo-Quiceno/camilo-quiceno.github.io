        As a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with over 3 years of experience and a <strong>Master's in Data Science</strong>, I specialize in designing and building scalable, data-driven solutions for large-scale distributed systems.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Currently, at <strong>Nu</strong>, I apply my expertise in microservices to the FinTech sector. As part of the Upper Funnel Pack, my focus is on transforming customer curiosity into action. I collaborate with Product and Design teams to build and enhance the services that guide customers seamlessly through their journey, from their first interaction to product selection, ultimately empowering them to make informed financial decisions.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Previously, at <strong>Talent.com</strong>, I played a key role in the full migration of their website from a PHP monolith to a modern microservices architecture using Go and TypeScript, deployed on Kubernetes and AWS. During this project, I transformed unstructured job listings into valuable, structured data and integrated real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to ensure optimal performance. This migration significantly improved scalability and set the foundation for new AI-driven capabilities.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My earlier experience includes leading the <strong>Plastic Design Team</strong> at Materialise, where I focused on quality assurance for customized surgical guides to ensure the highest standards of precision.
