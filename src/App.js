        I am Camilo Quiceno Quintero, a 28 years old <strong>Biomedical Engineer</strong>, from Colombia.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Since the beginning of 2017, I am working in the field of 3D-Printing as a designer of patient-specific surgical guides for cranio-maxillofacial surgeries at Materialise. I started as a full time designer and held this position during my first one year and a half years. After that I became the trainer and technical leader of the team. Nowadays I am the <strong>Team Leader</strong> of the Plastic Team.        
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        During my time at University I got interested about two topics, mechanical design and Software Development & Data Science, for that reason, by November 2019 I started to spend my free time to explore further the second area. I started to study Software Development & Data Science by my own and I have been learning Python and all its specialized libraries.        
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In 2022 I took this area more seriously. Currently I am studying a <strong>Master Degree in Data Science</strong>.      </>
